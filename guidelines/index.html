                    <p>This community thrives because of everyone&#39;s contributions. We exchange ideas, ask questions, answer some of them, have debates, or sometimes are here just to hang out. There are times when the nature of a question may seem simple, has been asked and answered, or may trigger some personal feelings. It may make you feel like a snide or hurtful remark is justified, but it isn&#39;t. If you do not have a thoughtful or helpful comment, please refrain from leaving a comment.</p>
                    <p>Please do not characterize questions others ask as stupid or simple; all questions are welcome. Please do not call out members for the tools they choose to use or the decisions they make.</p>
                    <p>Futile or petty debates about the code of conduct are highly discouraged. This doesn&#39;t mean you cannot raise concerns or issues, but please be considerate and constructive, rather than heated and destructive with your commentary.</p>
                    <p>A simple way to remember how you&#39;re expected to act: if you can&#39;t find anything nice to say, don&#39;t say anything.</p>

                    <li>Listen without interruption.</li>
                    <li>Believe what the person is saying &amp; do not attempt to disqualify what they have to say.</li>
                    <li>Ask for tips / help with avoiding making the offense in the future.</li>
                    <li>Apologize and ask forgiveness.</li>
